libprofinet
===========

A simplistic (attempt at an) implementation of the Profinet protocol suite,
used to communicate with Siemens PLCs.

This work is inspired by the existing
http://libnodave.sourceforge.net/[libnodave] code, which is a little hard to
follow.

Objectives
----------
To be able to read and write variables from/to a Siemens S7.

Target audience
---------------
Me. Just me. Don't use this, it'll turn your hair purple.
