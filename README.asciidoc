libs7comm
===========

A simplistic (attempt at an) implementation of the S7 communications protocol,
used to communicate with Siemens PLCs.

This work is inspired by the existing
http://libnodave.sourceforge.net/[libnodave] code, which is a little hard to
follow.

Objectives
----------
To be able to read and write variables from/to a Siemens S7-300.

Target audience
---------------
Me. Just me. Don't use this, it'll turn your hair purple.

Build requirements
-------------------
 * libpcap-dev
 * libcpputest-dev
 * gcc, g++, make
