As the Profinet standard is not freely available this is by neccessity a
reverse engineering project, which means that much of the following is
guesswork.

libnodave has already done some of this reverse engineering work, but I
suspect it got a few things wrong.
It does not seem to start from the assumption that the comminication is done
through the ISO COTP protocol (on top of TCP).

At least some of those standards are publicly available:
ISO Transport on top of TCP: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2126
 (Specifically 4.3 TPKT Packet Format)
 (Also note 6.1 TCP Connection Establishment)

ISO Transport specification: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc905
